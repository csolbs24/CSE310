# Overview

This is a simple tic-tac-toe command line application written so that I could learn the basic syntax of the c++ programming language.

# Development Environment

I used JetBrains CLion to develop this program. I used CLion because it shipped with everything necessary to compile my program. This made it easy to focus on learning c++ instead of having to worry about needing to separately install everything required to compile.

# Useful Websites

{Make a list of websites that you found helpful in this project}

The most helpful resource for me during this project was the w3schools c++ tutorial. Since I had zero c++ experience, I started off by following the entire tutorial. Then once I started working on the program, I would often refer back to the tutorial to help me with the syntax of what I was writing. Then whenever I had a question about something that the w3schools tutorial didn't cover, I would turn to stackoverflow to search for help on what I was doing. Links to both websites can be found below.

# Future Work

- One thing that would be really cool to add in the future to this program would be the ability to have variable board sizes.
- Another thing that could be improved is changing all the for loops to range based for loops, because apparently that is considered better practice.
- A final thing that could be really cool to add to this program would be multiple games. It could give you a menu that lets you select from multiple different games, and then return you to that menu when done playing the selected game.
